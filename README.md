Consider the Motor Position Control Model from the following link https://ctms.engin.umich.edu/CTMS/index.php?example=MotorPosition&amp;section=Simu linkModeling Build this system in Simulink. Design a PID controller to achieve following goals using basic building blocks For a 1-radian step reference, the design criteria are given are the following. • Settling time less than 0.040 seconds • Overshoot less than 16% • No steady-state error, even in the presence of a step disturbance input Build a reference model to use the PID along with this system. Use Data Dictionary
